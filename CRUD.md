CRUD is an acronym referring to the principal functions of a relational database.

        #Term        |       #SQL equivalent
C = Create           |      INSERT

U = Update (Modify)  |      UPDATE
D = Delete (Destroy) |      DELETE


SQL stands for Structured Query Language

It is a simplified special-purpose standardised language for managing data in a relational database management system. The core syntax never changes, even with updates. SQL in particular organises tables in lists of rows.
